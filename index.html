                    <p><i>Recently, during my job search, I have felt like I am walking through a dark tunnel without knowing when or where it will end. But as I kept moving forward, I realized why I felt this way. I set high expectations for myself, dream big, and constantly seek new challenges. The weight of all the things I want to accomplish sometimes feels overwhelming, but I remind myself that this pressure exists because I choose to aim high. No one else is imposing these goals on me; they are my ambitions. With that understanding, I see challenges not as obstacles but as part of the journey toward growth. Every challenge I overcome strengthens my skills and broadens my perspective, reinforcing my passion for problem-solving and innovation.</i></p> 
                    <p><i>Through this continuous pursuit of growth, I have developed a strong career goal as a software engineer. I have come to understand that technology exists to serve users. Whether it is a highly complex system or something seemingly simple, its true value lies in how effectively it meets users' needs. Every technology has a reason to exist as long as people rely on and engage with it, making it essential to consider their needs at every stage of development. However, companies do more than bring ideas to life. They must analyze user behavior, anticipate emerging needs, and continuously innovate to enhance experiences. This user-centered approach has been the most valuable lesson I have learned throughout my journey, shaping how I approach problem-solving with ownership, empathy, and strategic vision.</i></p>
                    <p><i>At Georgia Tech, I initially joined as a Software Engineer Intern and later took on additional responsibilities as a Full-time Software Engineer and Business Analyst. One key project was Building Automation, where I applied data analysis, process automation, and simulation techniques to enhance energy efficiency by 98 percent. By leveraging data visualization and real-time evaluation, I identified inefficiencies in power systems and optimized HVAC management, demonstrating the power of data-driven problem-solving.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Additionally, I worked on automating the Memorandum of Understanding workflow, a previously manual and error-prone process. By integrating API-based automation, I reduced processing time by 40 percent and minimized human errors, improving operational efficiency and cross-department collaboration.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Another impactful project was developing an AI-powered chatbot for Georgia Techâ€™s facilities website. By collaborating with Microsoft and integrating NLP, I helped create a system that allows faculty to quickly access the information they need, improving response time and user satisfaction. I also leveraged my web development skills to successfully deploy the chatbot onto the official website, ensuring a user-friendly design and seamless functionality to enhance the user experience.</i></p>
                    <p><i>These experiences have strengthened my ability to analyze systems, automate processes, and develop AI-driven solutions that enhance efficiency and usability. More importantly, they have shaped my perspective on software engineering to create meaningful impact. I am eager to apply my expertise in data-driven decision-making and automation to build technology that not only optimizes performance but also improves daily life in meaningful ways.</i></p>
                    <p><i> I set high expectations for myself, constantly pursuing new challenges. While this ambition can feel overwhelming, I see challenges as opportunities for growth. Through this mineset, I developed a strong career goal as a software </i></p>
