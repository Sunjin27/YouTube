            <h2>Describe your creative path so far</h2>
            <div class="about-container">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p><i>YouTube is where creativity and technology intersect, enabling innovative storytelling and interactive digital experiences. Developers at YouTube play a vital role in enhancing engagement by optimizing recommendation algorithms, integrating automation technologies, and refining user interactions to create a seamless and intuitive platform. Their work strengthens the connection between creators, users, and content, shaping how people interact with digital media.</i></p>
                    <p><i>My passion for interactive technology stems from my background in software engineering and my deep interest in building immersive digital experiences. I started a YouTube channel to stay connected with my parents in Korea, sharing moments of my daily life that could not be fully conveyed through calls or texts. Over time, I realized that creating videos was more than just a way to communicate. It became a medium for storytelling, self-expression, and community building. This experience deepened my understanding of how digital platforms facilitate engagement, sparking my desire to design intuitive and dynamic user experiences that enhance connectivity.</i></p>
                    <p><i>As a software engineer, I have always been drawn to the challenge of integrating technology with human interaction. At Samsung, I optimized SSD storage systems to improve data longevity and reliability, gaining a deeper understanding of how software impacts hardware performance. At LG Innotek, I automated testing for over 2,500 camera components, implementing image processing algorithms to enhance sensor quality. These experiences reinforced my ability to develop high-performance systems and leverage automation for efficiency.</i></p>
                    <p><i>At Georgia Tech, I focused on automation, AI-driven solutions, and workflow optimization. I led projects that reduced processing time by 40 percent, improved energy efficiency, and integrated AI-powered chatbots to enhance accessibility. These experiences refined my problem-solving skills and reinforced my belief that technology should not only improve efficiency but also create more engaging and interactive user experiences.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Software is not just about writing code. It is about creating solutions that drive efficiency, enhance user experiences, and turn creative visions into reality.

            <h2>Tell us about the most interesting way you’ve used AI in the last year.</h2>
            <div class="about-container">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p><i>One of the most interesting ways I’ve used AI in the past year was exploring how it influences content creation and user engagement. As a creator, I became increasingly aware of AI-driven algorithms shaping content discovery, especially in Shorts. AI-generated narration, instant video edits, and auto-suggested trending topics were becoming more common, and I was curious to see how leveraging these tools could impact engagement. I experimented by using AI to generate video ideas, structure content, and speed up editing. What typically took me more than five days of planning, editing, and uploading was reduced to just three hours. The efficiency was impressive, and for a moment, I imagined what it would be like to become a viral Shorts creator.</i></p>

                    <p><i>However, I quickly realized that while AI can optimize content for engagement, it lacks originality. It produces what the AI and algorithm favor, not necessarily what is authentic or meaningful. True creativity comes from individuality, and I did not want to lose that. AI can assist in content creation, but in the end, the most compelling stories come from human perspectives. This reinforced my belief that creativity is the key differentiator between AI and human ingenuity and that those who use AI as a tool rather than a replacement will be the ones to thrive.</i></p>

                    <p><i>Another fascinating use of AI was in personal reflection. There was a time when I had a lot on my mind and wanted to talk to someone but didn’t know who to turn to. Out of curiosity, I turned to GPT for advice. I described my situation, provided background information, and watched as it processed my words, analyzed emotions, and offered thoughtful responses. While I knew it was merely predicting text based on data, the way it mirrored back perspectives and insights felt unexpectedly comforting. It made me realize that AI, though not truly sentient, is being used by many as a source of support, providing a sense of connection when people need it most.</i></p>

                    <p><i>This, in many ways, parallels why I believe YouTube is such a powerful platform. People watch vlogs, engage with creators, and join communities because they seek connection. Just as I found a sense of relief sharing my thoughts with AI, I experienced similar fulfillment when I uploaded content to YouTube, knowing my experiences might resonate with others. YouTube’s strength lies in its ability to connect billions of users, giving everyone a space to share, learn, and interact. However, with this power comes challenges—algorithmic biases, the spread of harmful content, and the potential downsides of engagement-driven AI. As a developer, I want to contribute to making YouTube a platform where AI enhances, rather than diminishes, meaningful interactions. My goal is to ensure technology fosters creativity and connection while maintaining the authenticity that makes content truly valuable.</i></p>
